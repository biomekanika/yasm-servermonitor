# yasm-servermonitor
Yet Another Server Monitor. A simple server monitoring tool built on the Flask web application framework.

## Introduction
This project does not claim to be a full featured application or server monitoring tool. There are far more feature rich solutions out there. Instead, this is more of personal excercise in Python and Flask application development. If you find the project useful, feel free to use it and maybe even help to improve it. :)
